The purpose of this project is purely for fun and learning. It serves as a hands-on example for beginners to get started with the Godot game engine and understand some of its core features.

## Tutorial Source
The game was created by following the step-by-step tutorial provided by the Godot Engine documentation. The tutorial covers the basics of setting up a 2D game, creating player and enemy characters, handling input, collision detection, scoring, and game over conditions.

## Objective
In this game, the player controls a character using the arrow keys to move it around the screen. The goal is to avoid colliding with randomly moving enemy characters (creeps) for as long as possible. The longer the player survives without collisions, the higher the score.

## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys to control the player character.
- Try to avoid coming into contact with the creeps.
- Your score increases as you survive longer.
- The game ends if the player collides with any creep.

Have fun and challenge yourself to beat your high score!
